Same experiment as in Initial_Data BUT the measuring resistor (456 Ohm) was swapped out for a 45.9 Ohm resistor.

The 2nd op-amp was also brought in as a single one was struggling to supply enough current. Two parallel branches, each with a voltage follower and a 45.5 Ohm resistor, feed into the measuring resistor.

Lower frequencies were neglected as capacitance in the voltage follower capped the maximum current at low frequencies.

scope_101 to scope_110 are at 10 Hz
scope_111 to scope_120 are at 20 Hz
scope_121 to scope_130 are at 50 Hz
scope_131 to scope_140 are at 100 Hz

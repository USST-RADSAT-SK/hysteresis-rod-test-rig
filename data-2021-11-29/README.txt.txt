Same experiment as in data-2021-11-27 BUT the measuring resistor (45.9 Ohm) was swapped out for a 9.9 Ohm resistor.

The two 45.5 Ohm resistors were also replaced with 9.9 Ohm resistors.

scope_143 to scope_147 are at 0.1 Hz with ~250 A/m
scope_149 to scope_152 are at 1 Hz with ~250 A/m
scope_153 to scope_158 are at 1 Hz with ~300 A/m
scope_159 to scope_162 are at 0.1 Hz with ~300 A/m

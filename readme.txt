Circuit description:

4.2V (peak to peak) input sine wave goes through a voltage follower (LT1636CN8), a 456 +/- 2 Ohm resistor, and the generator coil (all in series). The voltage across the resistor is measured in CH1.

The measuring coil is around the generating coil, and the voltage across the measuring coil is measured in CH2.

Generator coil:
 - meausred resistance: R = 102.2 +/- 0.2 Ohm
 - N = 1900 +/- 50 turns
 - length: l = 19 cm
 - computed inductance: L = 2.98 +/- 0.16 mH

Measuring coil:
 - measured resistance: R = 322.6 +/- 0.2 Ohm
 - N = 2929 +/- 50 turns
 - length: l = 2.5 +/- 0.3 cm
 - computed inductance: L = 225 +/- 55 mH
